This project is a Java Swing application that visualizes the Insertion Sort algorithm in real time. It generates a random array of integers and represents each value as a vertical bar, updating the display as elements shift and are inserted into their correct positions. The animation uses timed delays and repainting to clearly show each iteration of the algorithm, making it easier to understand how insertion sort works step by step. This project was created for learning purposes to practice algorithms, Java graphics, and basic multithreading concepts.
